## Introduction

AyaMed leverages the multilingual capabilities of the Aya model to address global health challenges posed by non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and vector-borne diseases (VBDs). By providing accessible and reliable health information, AyaMed aims to improve health literacy and outcomes on a global scale.

## About the Diseases

### Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs)

NCDs are chronic diseases that are not passed from person to person. They are the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for 74% of all deaths globally. Common NCDs include:

- **Cardiovascular Diseases:** Conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels, such as heart disease and stroke.
- **Cancers:** Diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body.
- **Chronic Respiratory Diseases:** Conditions affecting the lungs and airways, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
- **Diabetes:** A chronic condition characterized by high blood sugar levels due to insufficient insulin production or ineffective insulin use.

### Vector-Borne Diseases (VBDs)

VBDs are illnesses transmitted by vectors such as mosquitoes, ticks, and flies. They account for more than 17% of all infectious diseases and cause over 700,000 deaths annually. Examples include:

- **Malaria:** A life-threatening disease caused by parasites transmitted through the bites of infected mosquitoes.
- **Dengue Fever:** A mosquito-borne viral infection that can lead to severe flu-like illness.
- **Zika Virus:** A viral infection primarily transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, known for its potential impact on fetal development.
